# CNP25-CHIKV-nsP3-Macrodomain

An [SGC]((https://www.thesgc.org/)) Open Chemistry Networks Project (number 25) devoted to improving a hit found against CHIKV-nsP3-Macrodomain. The project is run as part of the READDI-AViDD consortium.

You contribute synthetic chemistry and in return the SGC/READDI offers biology. Together we can generate tool compounds to understand biology and validate drug targets to help cure disease. Everything is open, with all content governed by a CC-BY-4.0 licence.

If this sounds interesting, and you agree to the simple [RULES](https://www.thesgc.org/sgc-open-chemistry-networks/terms-of-use), you can get started.

For the science background, head to the [wiki](https://github.com/StructuralGenomicsConsortium/CNP25-CHIKV-nsP3-Macrodomain/wiki) or check out the living paper that is being written (here) (need link) (link is also (Need tinyurl link).

For answers to all the questions you have, go to the [FAQs](https://www.thesgc.org/sgc-open-chemistry-networks/faq).

If you'd like to contact someone to talk about contributing, then write something in an Issue (see the tab above), which is a good way to communicate openly. (Issues describe what currently needs doing and act as a discussion forum - you need a Github account but it's super easy and not spammy. There's also an email address (chemistry@thesgc.org) you can use to ask questions. You can read more about all this in the ["How To"](https://github.com/StructuralGenomicsConsortium/Chemistry_TechOps_HowTo/wiki) area
